`sqliface` is a package for the Go programming language that contains a set of interfaces and implementations that help make code utilizing `database/sql` more testable. This package has only been tested with a MySQL database. Pull Requests for utilizing other databases' custom types are appreciated (i.e. `mysql.NullTime`).
